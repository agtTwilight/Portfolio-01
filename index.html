                        <p> My code emphasizes concision and efficiency, and my development style is calm and collected. On a team, I hope to be your go to UX developer, and I work best when paired with UI-savy developers. I love to teach and connect with my peers, and I am currently looking for a software developer position that can help me grow as both a mentor and developer.</p>

                                        <p>I made this CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet from scratch during the first week of my coding bootcamp. It was my first time coding with flexbox in CSS, and I learned a lot! I'm proud that just a few days after my flexbox introduction I was able to make this portfolio page from scratch.</p>
