# portfolio-01

## Description
I made this portfolio website by only using HTML and CSS. I created this website to satisfy an assignment for my coding bootcamp, but also to provide myself with a strong foundation portfolio, for when I return and add JavaScript! This is the first website I have made completely from scratch, with no source code from my bootcamp, and it helped me master CSS box theory, flexbox, media queries, and a few of the interactions provided in base CSS. Hope you enjoy, and please do come back to any future porfolios I make, to see the progress of my development career! <br />

## Tutorial
There are a few features that this website has for you to interact with. Refer to the gif for further reference as you navigate the site, but in brief:
1. Clicking on any nav bar element in the top right will scroll you to the pages section that matches the nav bar element.
2. Hovering over any project will produce a description for the project, including it's name and links to a deployed website and it's respective repo.
3. Clicking on any of the footer elements will link you to my github, linkedin, and allow you to email me, respectively.
